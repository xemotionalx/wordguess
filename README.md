# Who's That Pokemon?!

## About the App
This is a hangman game based on the "Who's that Pokemon?!" challenge from the animated series.

## Overview
This app uses vanilla javascript to randomly select pokemon from an array. It responds to an on key up event, allowing the user to guess the letters. Correct letters get added to their correct location, incorrect letters are added to the 'letters guessed' sections.
Each time the user guesses correctly, they earn a point and the round resets.
Once the user guesses incorrectly too many times, the game ends.

## Future development

Right now the game is a little boring because there are only 5 pokemon programmed in. Future iterations will have more pokemon, levels, a timer, and the pokemon will not repeat.
